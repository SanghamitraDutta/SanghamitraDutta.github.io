###### Use of Data Science to Inform Marketing Decisions
---



**Background**  
Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) are faced with 3 key challenges:  
  * Creating awareness for their organization and cause
  * Acheiving high attendence for the gala they will host in early summer
  * Fund raising for the cause/organization  

And to this end, they wish to leverage insights from MTA Turnstile data for placement of their street promotion teams.    


**Our Objective**   
Provide recommendations to WTWY that ensures the utmost quantity and quality of reach


**Assumptions**
* We looked at the Exit data as we believe that while entrying the station the commuters are not likely to respond to street team querries as they would be in a hurry to board a train


**Additional Data Sources Analyzed**
* **Internal Revenue Service(IRS) Data:** We wanted to target residents in wealthy neighbourhoods of NYC who could donate to the cause and also influence policy making  
* **NYC Tech Company Addresses:** It was crucial to reach out to tech company employees and therefore we identified areas in the city with concentration of tech companies 


**Key Findings**  
I.

Our initial analysis showed very high Exit volumes at major commuter and tourist hubs like Grand Central, Time Square and Penn Station. So we deicided to eliminate these stations to ensure better quality of reach and in turn improve chances of conversion.

 Two pronged strategy:
 1. Mornings people exiting the station are going to work - Focus on higher concentration of tech companies
 2. Evenings, people exiting the station are going home - Focus on wealthier neighbourhoods
